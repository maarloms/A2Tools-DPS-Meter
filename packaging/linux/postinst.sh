# CAP_NET_RAW; grant it to the installed binary so the meter never has to run
# as root. A new binary (every upgrade) needs it again. The Arch package does
# the same in packaging/arch/a2tools-dps-meter.install; the .rpm declares it in
# the package instead (packaging/linux/a2-tools-dps-meter.spec).
