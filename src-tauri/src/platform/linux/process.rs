//! Setup for the whole process, before the UI starts.

//! WebKitGTK's DMA-BUF renderer shares GPU buffers with the compositor, and
//! on some Wayland setups (NVIDIA drivers especially) the compositor rejects
//! them: the window never opens and GTK reports "Error 71 (Protocol error)
//! dispatching to Wayland display" (issue #7, KDE Plasma on CachyOS). Turning
//! that renderer off is the usual fix for WebKitGTK apps. The meter draws a
//! light UI, so the GPU path buys it nothing it would miss. A value the
//! player set themselves is left alone, so `=0` turns it back on.
