//! A fight's buffs and debuffs, compact enough to keep with the fight in
//! History: the abnormal tracks (`capture::abnormal::tracks`) on the fight's
//! actors, on their summons and on its target, cut to the fight's window.
//!
//! One `BuffTrack` per entity, abnormal and caster: every time that caster's
//! abnormal was on that entity in the fight, as segments of constant stacks.
//! Summons are resolved to their owners when the fight is saved, because
//! their entity ids are reused after a map load. A passive (an abnormal with
//! no timer, on from before the fight to past its end) is kept as a flag, with
//! no segments.
