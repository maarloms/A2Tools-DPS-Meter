//!
//! - `abnormal` is a `SkillAbnormal` id; `skill` the skill that applied it;
//!   `level` that skill's level (a passive's base + board + gear level).
//! - `instance` is numbered per entity. A stacking buff is one instance per
//!   stack: Element Unification at 5 stacks is 5 live instances. A stack
//!   past the limit (SkillAbnormal `AbnormalOverlapCount`) pushes out the
//!   oldest, which for Element no record ends. A debuff that several players
//!   keep up is one instance; a change names whoever applied it last.
//! - `end` is the server's clock in ms since the epoch (2100-01-01 00:00 in
//!   Korea when the abnormal never ends, length -1); `length` runs from the
//!   instance's start to `end`. A change that renews a stack keeps the start;
//!   one that applies the abnormal again restarts it (the byte before the
//!   position is then 2).
//! - Reason 1 is the timer running out; kind 7 (reason 11) is a skill taking
//!   the abnormal off, the skill named; reason 5 a passive replaced by its new
//!   level at login. Other reasons are not decoded.
//! - Stats are `EStat` ids; percent stats in hundredths. `4a 36` comes for
//!   your own character only, with the new value of each stat that changed.
//! - A spawn record (`41 36` a summon or monster, `45 36` another player) and
//!   your self record (`33 36`, at each map load) list every abnormal the
//!   entity has on, in the add layout. A spirit's list holds its passive at
//!   the level of its summon skill. See `listed`.
//!
//! Every add, change and removal record in 19 captures of 2026-10-04 to
//! 2026-10-06 (336,702 adds and changes, 57,886 removals) reads to its last
//! byte with this layout.
//!
//! Ported from Seralth's Daevalog (GPL-3.0), `src-tauri/src/capture/abnormal.rs`.
