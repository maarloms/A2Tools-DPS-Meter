//! The last stretch of captured traffic, held in memory, so a boss fight can be
//! turned into an Evidence Slice without packet logging having been on.
//!
//! Packet logging writes everything to disk and is off by default, for good
//! reason: a capture holds chat and bystanders. But a slice can only be cut
//! from the packets, so without this nobody could upload a fight unless they
//! had thought to turn logging on first.
//!
//! What is here never touches disk. It is the same segments the parser is
//! already being fed, kept for about an hour and then dropped; the only thing
//! ever written is the slice the builder cuts from it, which is allowlisted,
//! name-blinded and verified, and only for a fight the meter saved.
